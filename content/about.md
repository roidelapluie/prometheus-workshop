## Be ready to discover a new and very effective approach to monitoring.

Prometheus brings monitoring to another level, when everything is about metrics
and graphs. It puts the data first, and takes advantage of multiple service
discovery systems. This workshop will dive into its ecosystem and teach you how
to get the best out of it.

  standard monitoring
